Use this file to record your reflection on this assignment.

- What are your initial impressions of how `Encapsulation` affects your programming?
* Very confusing still - I'm not entirely sure I **fully** understand how it all works, but I think its starting to come together a little bit...
* I definietely might need some more clarification and guidance as we go ahead
- What worked, what didn't, what advice would you give someone taking this course in the future?
* Google, TA hours, and office hours worked, as well as talking to other students in the class 
* What didn't work was just staring at my computer - It helped to at least be breaking things down and writing something (even if it was just rewriting the instructions on paper) to make me feel productive and start getting in the mindset of working o this
* DON'T JUMP STRAIGHT IN! Things will be very overwhelming if you do that. Instead read through the instructions and rubric a few times, write out a general plan, and then slowly start easing your way into things.
