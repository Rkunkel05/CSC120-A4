- What are your initial impressions of how `Encapsulation` affects your programming?
Overall, I find encapsulation to still be slightly confusing, and I'm not entirely sure I ful understand how it all works. I think I understand the importance of it, but I am still working on understanding how to apply and utilize it best! 

- What worked, what didn't, what advice would you give someone taking this course in the future?
Talking to classmates and using resources like Google were very useful. What didn't work for me was just staring at my computer. When I initially went to start on this, I was very quickly overwhelemed with all of the steps. It helped me to start by breaking things down and writing something (even if it was just rewriting the instructions on paper) to make me feel productive and in the mindset of coding. My biggest advice is to not jump straight in! Ease your way into this assignment, read through the instructions and the rubric a few times, and write out a general plan before starting to code.
